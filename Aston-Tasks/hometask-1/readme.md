### About me

Alright, so I am very **~~fucking~~ lazy** but also smart guy from a city of Yalta that is in Crimea. My name is Danny, born on 11.11.1997.
**10 000+ hours** waisted in computer games, which is more that 1 whole year without sleeping, eating etc.
Same amount of time is required to bring balance for my dire side of the soul. This is going to be achieved by learning old Jedi **DevOps** ways.
